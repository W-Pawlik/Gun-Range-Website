# Gun-Range-Website

Gun-Range-Website is a web page created for educational purposes. The project was built using the following technologies:
- JavaScript
- CSS
- SCSS
- HTML

## Project Focus

In this project, I aimed to master the use of the SASS preprocessor and reinforce key JavaScript concepts. The website was created as a portfolio for a friend who offers shooting lessons.

### JavaScript Features

- **Map**: Implemented using the Leaflet library to display a location map.
- **Animations**: Utilized the `IntersectionObserver` API to add scroll-triggered animations.
- **Mobile Navigation**: Designed a mobile navigation menu to create a responsive design.
- **Slider**: Added a slider to showcase content dynamically.

### Game

I developed a thematic **Target Shooting Game**. In this game, a target appears on the screen, and the player must click on it with the mouse to score points. The goal is to hit as many targets as possible to earn points in one minute.
